# Beginner Python Projects üêç

Welcome to my Beginner Python Projects repository! This collection showcases some of the early projects I created when I was just starting to learn Python at the age of 10-12. These projects reflect my journey as a young coder, exploring the basics of programming and problem-solving.

## About the Projects üìÇ
In this repository, you'll find a variety of simple yet fun projects that I built during my beginner stage. These projects were designed to help me understand core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and basic algorithms.

One unique aspect of these projects is that I intentionally avoided using built-in functions and external modules (except of Number Guessing Game, Snake Water Gun, Temperature Teller). My goal was to challenge myself to think critically and implement solutions from scratch, which helped me build a strong foundation in programming logic.
## Why This Repository? ‚ùì

### For Beginners:
 If you're new to Python or programming in general, these projects can serve as a great starting point. They are simple, easy to understand, and demonstrate fundamental concepts.

### For Inspiration:
 These projects show that age is just a number when it comes to learning and creating. If I could do it at 10-12 years old, so can you!

### For Employers:
 As I am actively seeking job opportunities, this repository is a testament to my early passion for coding, problem-solving skills, and dedication to learning. It reflects my ability to think creatively and work independently, even at a young age.
## Projects Included üõ†Ô∏è
Here are some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

### 1) _th Smallest Number:
 A small project in which you will enter some numbers and then the program will make a sorted array in ascending order and you can even ask the _th smallest number of the array.

### 2) A software error in data entry:
 This project was made on a situation given by my Mentor. 

Situation: In some entries of college names, an error ocurred because of which the letters 'mgpt' started to occur in between the names of colleges. This made it hard to read the college names. Make a code to remove these letters from the entry to make it normal.

### 3) Fibonacci:
 You have to enter the no. of series and the program will make fibonacci series till number you entered.

### 4) Find Triplets with Zero Sum:
 In this program, you can enter no of numbers (atleast 3). The program will analyze the list of numbers and then find three numbers of the array which will add up to 0.

### 5) Number Guessing Game:
 Program has decided a number between 1-100 and you have to guess the number based on the hints given by the game after every game.

### 6) Library Management:
 It is a virtual library in which you can see, borrow or return some books.

### 7) Movie Theater Seats Management:
 A Movie Theater Seats Management system to book a ticket for you.

### 8) Snake Water Gun Game:
 A game just like rock, paper, scissors to play with your very own Computer.

### 9) Sorting the numbers:
 Add some numbers and the program will help you to sort the numbers in ascending numbers.

### 10) Temperature Teller:
 In this program, I have used an API to fetch the temperature of a particular city.

#### Each project is accompanied by its source code.
## My Early Coding Philosophy üí°
When I started coding, my goal was to avoid using built-in functions and modules as much as possible. This approach forced me to understand the underlying logic of how things work. For example:

Instead of using max() or min(), I wrote my own logic to find the maximum or minimum value in a list.

Instead of relying on external libraries, I implemented basic algorithms manually.

This not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also gave me a deeper appreciation for the power of programming.
## My Goal üéØ
As I continue to grow as a developer, my ultimate goal is to land a job where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to meaningful projects. If you're an employer or someone interested in my work, feel free to reach out! I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
